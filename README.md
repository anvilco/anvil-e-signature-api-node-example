# Anvil Coding Takehome
Hello 👋 & welcome to the anvil coding challenge. We appreciate you taking the time to complete the assignment and we're excited about the prospect of you joining the team!

The goal of this assignment is to get a sense for how you think and solve problems, not for us to test magic keyword knowledge of our tech stack. If you're having build issues 🔧 with the project, please don't hesitate to contact us.

## How it works

* You will get an email from one of us with the specific task to complete
* Fork this repo into your own account
* Make a new branch
* When you are finished, make a PR on your fork, and invite the person specified in the email to your fork
* We will take a look at your solution, then talk through your solution during your interview

## Getting the project running

```bash
# Fork this project, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/...

cd anvil-coding-challenge

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start development server
yarn dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000

# Run the linter, server tests, and client tests
yarn test
```

Other helpful things

```bash
yarn lint # Only the linter
yarn test:server # Only the server tests
yarn test:client # Only the client tests

yarn db:reset # Reset the DB to the initial seed data
```

## What even is it?

It's a single page app that shows a list of files.
